# Color Switcher App

A minimal and interactive Color Switcher Web App built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
This project demonstrates how simple DOM interactions can be used to produce dynamic UI changes with clean, beginner-friendly code.

The app allows users to instantly change the webpage background color by clicking on colored buttons.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎛️ Interactive Color Buttons — click a color to apply it as the background
- ⚡ Fast DOM Event Handling using addEventListener()
- 🔁 Event Targeting with event.target.id
- 🎨 Clean Layout & Modern Styling using CSS
- 📱 Responsive design for all devices
- 🧩 Lightweight & beginner-friendly code structure

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Styling
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — Logic & event handling

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- index.html   
- style.css    
- app.js       
- readme.md

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The page loads with four color buttons: Red, White, Green, Pink.
2. Each button has an id equal to its color name.
3. When a button is clicked:
   - JavaScript detects the event
   - Extracts the clicked button’s id
   - Updates the page’s background using body.style.backgroundColor
4. The UI updates instantly, giving users a clean and simple color-switching experience.

1. Download or extract the project folder
2. Extract the files (if zipped)
3. Open index.html in any browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
4. Click the colored buttons
5. Watch the background update instantly!
   
No server or installation required.

## 📌 Limitations

- Only basic color switching functionality
