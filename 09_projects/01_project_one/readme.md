⚡ Fast DOM Event Handling using addEventListener()

🔁 Event Targeting with event.target.id

🎨 Clean Layout & Modern Styling using CSS

📱 Responsive design for all devices

🧩 Lightweight & beginner-friendly code structure

🛠️ Tech Stack

⚙️ How It Works

The page loads with four color buttons: Red, White, Green, Pink.

Each button has an id equal to its color name.

When a button is clicked:

JavaScript detects the event

Extracts the clicked button’s id

Updates the page’s background using body.style.backgroundColor

The UI updates instantly, giving users a clean and simple color-switching experience.

▶️ How to Run

Download or extract the project folder

Open index.html in any browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)

Click the colored buttons

Watch the background update instantly!

No server or setup required.
