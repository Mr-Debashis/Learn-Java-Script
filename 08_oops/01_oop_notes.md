# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a style of programming that uses classes and objects to model real-world things like data and behavior. A class is a blueprint that defines the properties and methods an object can have, while an object is a specific instance created from that class.


# Objects
# In JavaScript, an object is a collection of data (properties) and actions (methods) stored as key–value pairs.

# Properties hold values like strings, numbers, or even other objects.
# Methods are functions inside the object that define what it can do.
# Objects let you group related data and functionality together in one place.


# Classes
# In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and methods. A class itself doesn’t hold values, it describes what an object should have and do. You create actual objects from a class using the new keyword.

## 4 Pillars JS OOPs
# 1. Abstraction
Abstraction is one of the key features of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. It means showing only the essential information and hiding unnecessary details from the user. Data abstraction refers to exposing only what is necessary to interact with the object while keeping the background details or internal logic hidden.

# 2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up data and information under a single unit. In Object-Oriented Programming, encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them together in a class.

# 3. Inheritance
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.

# 4. Polymorphism
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of an entity to behave different in different scenarios. person at the same time can have different characteristics.
