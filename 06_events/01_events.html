    /*
    **HTML events are things that happen to HTML elements.

    Examples of events:----
    An HTML button is clicked
    A web page has finished loading
    The mouse moves over an element
    A keyboard key is pressed
    An HTML input field is changed

    **Here is a list of some common HTML events:--------

    onchange	------     An HTML element has been changed
    onclick	The ------     user clicks an HTML element
    onmouseover	------     The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
    nmouseout	------     The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
    onkeydown	------     The user pushes a keyboard key
    onload	    ------     The browser has finished loading the page

    **JavaScript Events

    Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.
    When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can react on events.
    JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
    HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

    In js always using ***addEventListener() is the recommended way to handle events.

    **Common Mouse Events -------
    click
    Fires after both a mousedown and mouseup event occur on the same element with the main mouse button (usually the left).

    dblclick
    Fires after two rapid clicks on the same element.

    mousedown / mouseup
    These events fire when a mouse button is pressed down (mousedown) or released (mouseup) over an element, respectively.

    mousemove
    Fires continuously as the mouse pointer moves over an element, providing positional information (coordinates) about the cursor.

    mouseover
    Fires when the pointer moves over an element (or one of its children).

    mouseout
    Fires when the pointer leaves an element.

    mouseenter
    Similar to mouseover, but fire when the pointer enters an element, not its descendants, making it more sensible for use cases like CSS :hover   behavior.

    mouseleave
    Similar to mouseout, but fire when the pointer leaves an element, not its descendants, making it more sensible for use cases like CSS :hover behavior.

    contextmenu
    Fires when the user attempts to open the context menu, typically by right-clicking.

    wheel
    Fires when the mouse wheel is rotated, commonly used for scrolling or zooming functionality.

    drag events
    A series of events (dragstart, dragend, dragover, etc.) used for implementing drag-and-drop interfaces.

    //This is one way to add event on html element (This is not recomended)
    document.getElementById('button-1').onclick = function () {
        alert("Button 1 is clicked")
    }

    //Some other method or way to add event on element by using attachEvent() ---- on jQuery

    //This is the best way to add event on an element
    document.getElementById('button-2').addEventListener('click', function () {
        console.log("Button 2 is clicked");
    })

    //Event object & Event Propagation
    document.getElementById('button-3').addEventListener('click', function (e) {  //**e is event object
        console.log(e);
    }, true) //Here we use **default false or true -- that is event propagation


    //Here is the example of event bubbling (false) and capturing (true)
    document.getElementById('buttons').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
        console.log("Click inside the ul");
    }, true)
    document.getElementById('button-4').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
        console.log("Button 4 is clicked");
    }, true)

    //We can change or set propagation and other things easily by using event object with methods
    document.getElementById('button-5').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        e.stopPropagation()
        console.log("Button 5 is clicked");
    }, false)


    document.querySelector('#buttons').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
        console.log(e.target.tagName);
        if (e.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
            console.log(e.target.id);
            let removeIt = e.target.parentNode
            removeIt.remove()
        }
    });
    // removeIt.parentNode.removeChild(removeIt)  //This remove mothod is confusing but mostly use this in real project.



    //Some important topics on Events-------
    // type, timestamp, defaultPrevented
    // target, toElement, srcElement, currentTarget,
    // clientX, clientY, screenX, screenY
    // altkey, ctrlkey, shiftkey, keyCode
